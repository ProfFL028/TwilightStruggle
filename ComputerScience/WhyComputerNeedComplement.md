# Why Computer Need Complement?
Complement can simplify computer design because when computer makes minus operator easy, it treat negative number as the inverse number of positive number. When the number comes into 0, 
the +0 and -0 have different inverse number which makes +0 and -0 unequal. To fix the problem, computer represent negative number 1 step back. 
## How are positve numbers represented in a computer? 
Numbers are represented in Binary format. Take 32bit-integer for example, 11 is represented as 0000 0000 0000 1011.
## How are negative numbers represented in a computer and why?
-11 is represented as 1111 1111 1111 0101
## How to computer minus operator?
Take 11 - 11 for example, computer treat minus 11 as plus negative 11. and 0000 0000 0000 1011 plus 1111 1111 1111 0101 comes to 0.
